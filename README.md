# MergerApp
Create an HHI/CR4 application -- any language platform of your choosing: 1. The app should accept starting market shares for a market with 1 to 8 firms. 2. After market shares are entered, the app should calculate both HHI and CR4. 3. DOJ guidelines: https://www.justice.gov/atr/horizontal-merger-guidelines-08192010#5c 4. Then, based on DOJ guidelines, the app should indicate whether the market is Unconcentrated, Moderately Concentrated or Highly Concentrated Markets. 5. The app should next allow the user to enter a proposed merger and calculate the new HHI and new CR4 and the differences in the old/new HHI and old/new CR4’s. 6. Then, based on DOJ guidelines, the app should indicate whether the updated market would be Unconcentrated, Moderately Concentrated or Highly Concentrated Markets.
